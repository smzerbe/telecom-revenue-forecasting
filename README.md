# telecom-revenue-forecasting

This project builds a time series forecasting model using SARIMAX to predict daily telecom revenue trends. It includes full data preparation, seasonal decomposition, parameter tuning, model diagnostics, and future revenue projection.

---

## Project Overview

- Objective: Forecast future daily telecom revenue using historical transaction data
- Model: SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous regressors)
- Dataset: Daily revenue data for a telecom provider over a multi-year period

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Time series preprocessing and visualization
- Stationarity testing (ADF test)
- Seasonal decomposition
- ACF/PACF analysis for lag identification
- Auto-ARIMA parameter tuning
- SARIMAX modeling and evaluation
- Forecasting and model diagnostics (residual plots, AIC, etc.)
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`, `pmdarima`
